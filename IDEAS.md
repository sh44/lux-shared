# Lux in Tenebris ideas
### General
* goal is to reach top of the map
### Map
* infinite 3d map
* map is grid based
* whole map is filled with dungeons
* ancient mayan inspired dungeons
    * some are active with no wines
        * filled with monsters, guardians and traps
        * high-value treasure/gear/materials inside
    * the rest is like a wilderness
        * filled with animals and "plants"
    * there are different zones or "biomes" of dungeons
        * they are procedurally generated
        * generated monsters and items
        * different levels and rewards
        * zones have random names
            * maybe like in dwarf fortress?
    * random plague in rooms
    * the plague takes over nearby open rooms slowly
    * the plague is dark, it eats all light
    * the plague grows much quicker in darkness
    * the plague can be fought with, but its quite slow
    * the plague turns entities into a dark, fast and aggressive version
        * dark entities will have a negative effect on light
* occasional towns and caverns
* some source of light exists but its mostly dark
* various game modes
    * start in a cold biome with a furnace
    * start without eyes but with very good hearing abilities
### Mechanics
* co-op survival multiplayer
    * players specializing in various schools of magic being efficient
* food water and light are neccesary to survive
    * survival should be a hard in beginning
    * survival shouldnt limit the player later
    * lack of light affecting sanity
* player is free to build and rearrange the dungeons
    * player could build mechanisms and fortify the dungeons
    * exploring each dungeon is a risk to take, especially in some biomes
* dynamic combat system
* weapons are hotline miami-like
    * sword slashes
    * bows
    * maybe primitive guns
* game assets loadable with lua or other language
* physics engine
* entities move freely or on a smaller grid
* entities can fall down
* realistic health system
    * various statistics like consciousness or vision
        * affecting each other and character's activities and senses
    * hitboxes which localize the damage
        * a character could lose an arm or eye for example
* advanced magic system
    * magic works on the principle of equivalent exchange
    * basic magic can be cast using one's lifeforce
        * the magical power can also be held in special items
        * the power is collected by slow destruction of things
        * or other alternative forms of energy
    * possible spells are based on knowledge
        * a chemist can create flammable substances to create fire
        * biologists can heal wounds
            * on advanced levels they would be able to synthesize organic materials
        * a person with engineering knowledge can create and repair mechanisms
        * schools like enchanting or biology could allow recreating lost limbs
        * biologists have access to blood magic that has horryfing consequences
    * advanced combinations of spells can be created in a menu
        * various materials and spells can take various forms and shapes
        * combinations allowing to cast many spells at once
        * thanks to the menu, the player can create his spells before fighting
* sanity system
    * whispers and blurred visions
    * on very low sanity you see horryfing abominations and the world becomes bloody
### Graphics
* 3d
* the view is top down
    * perpendicular to the ground
* you can see levels below, darker or something
* extensive light system
* extensive field of vision system
* minimap showing the dungeon zones
